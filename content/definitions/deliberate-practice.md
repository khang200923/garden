title: Deliberate practice
---
> On top of the requirements for [[purposeful-practice|purposeful practice]], deliberate practice is informed by an understanding of how to do well. In the best case, this understanding is conferred by a professional teacher (a "coach"). This teacher will be able to evaluate where a student sits with respect to the various necessary sub-skills, recommend specific practice tasks to improve sub-skills which are lacking, and give advice about how to improve technique.
