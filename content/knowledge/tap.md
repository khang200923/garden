> *Trigger-Action Planning (TAP), sometimes Trigger-Action Patterns, and formerly Implementation Intentions are techniques for getting oneself to successfully enact desired actions (or inactions) by training something like a "stimulus-response" pair. The technique was spread by CFAR which initially drew upon the psychology literature of Implementation Intentions.*
