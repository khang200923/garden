title: Required improvements
draft: "true"
---
At the time of writing (2025-06-30), I have various personal improvements I need to make for myself. That includes:
- Focusing more
	- Every day, meditate and close my eyes for a specified amount of time. Ideally start with 2 minutes, and increase that amount subtly
- Being more epistemically accurate
	- One way of doing this is to trade on prediction markets; I already have a [Manifold account](https://manifold.markets/khang2009) for this. However, another way which I think is better is to:
		- Find 3-10 forecasting questions which will resolve soon (maybe collect them from Manifold Markets?)
		- Make predictions and write down the reasoning for each of them. Make sure they are detailed (>~ 100 words)
		- When all of these questions resolve, review the predictions and the reasoning and... try to improve them
		- Or better yet, make other predictions that rely substantially on these, so that when they resolve those predictions can get some update
		- Use Guesstimate models if applicable
- Improve [[definitions/prune|babbling]] skill
